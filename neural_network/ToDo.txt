1. NN is working.
2. Simulation for test environment is working.
TO DO:
    - double check that hebbian learning is working properly...
    - Try doubling the inputs - 25 for state of robot and 25 for state of goal --- currently they are in the same system and the NN has no way of knowing whicvh is which -- would require non-markov learning which is more complex
To Do:
	- DONE tool to plot individual neurons current state -> as a frequency plot.
	- Have to convert neurons to run with their own unique connections
	- Hebbian learning.
	- hebbian learning with reinforcement.
	- add in dynamic reinforcement.

How to train?
tunable parameters: 
		- resting_frequency. (should this be constant?)
		- recieve_fire transmition value (should this be constant?)
		- decay_rate. (should this be constant?)
		- current_state neuron fire threshold 
		- neuron connections.
		- neuron position.
		- new neurons.


How to train each parameter?
Training procedure:
	1. Run simulation for set time horrizon.
	2. Observe successes and failure based on some fitness function of the neural network. (euclidean distance to goal)
	3. Based on whole time event horrizon identify neurons involved in successful actions.
	4. Maintain and/or increase strength of these identified successful neurons and reduce relevance of outside neurons (reduce connections, increase thresholds etc.)
	5. add new connections trail connections in successful neurons to surrounding neurons.  
	6. Remove redundant neurons and initialise additional neurons about places in the successful pipeline.

1. Hebbian Learning. (if x fires just before y fires then strengthen connection, if y fires just before x fires then weaken connection)
